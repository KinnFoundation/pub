							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/KINNDAO.png" alt="NFT" class="responsive" /></span>
							<h4>Introduction</h4>
							<p>The goal of Kinn DAO is to improve the Algorand NFT ecosystem by helping marketplaces work together. Creating a cross-platform system means that marketplaces can reduce overlap and focus on building out their unique features. A DAO structure will also help solve bigger problems in the NFT ecosystem by pooling resources and development.</p>
							<h4>Curation</h4>
							<p>Collectors work hard to identify the best NFTs, and artists work to promote themselves. Unfortunately, rewards for these efforts have been uncertain and unfairly distributed. Instead, Kinn DAO will reward its token holders for their upvotes and social engagement in a new vote-to-earn system. Holders will be able to create and manage their own collections, with rewards paid by NFT sales from participating marketplaces.
								A mess of Twitter, Discord, and Telegram groups have emerged that make it difficult to stay up to date on every project. Kinn DAO is developing a common on-chain standard for aggregating votes, comments, and other social metadata across marketplaces to the benefit of collectors and artists.</p>
							<h4>Verification</h4>
							<p>As an ecosystem grows, scams unfortunately become more frequent. Often, the burden falls on the real NFT project to protect or reimburse collectors. Although scams can never be fully eliminated, Kinn DAO has developed an automated verification system using a transparent algorithm that works for many types of content including images and videos. This algorithm will make it much more difficult to steal content from legitimate creators. 
								While the algorithm works well for detecting content originality, it cannot prevent all scams. Kinn DAO solves for difficult edge cases by rewarding token holders for voting on quality content. The same system that rewards holders for curation will encourage verification and reporting. Decentralized verification with automated components will be faster, more scalable, and more accurate than manual approaches.</p>
							<h4>Cooperation</h4>
							<p>Kinn DAO aims to provide marketplaces with all the services they need to safely scale up the ecosystem. Best practices will be distributed across the community to avoid repeating errors and improve user experience. All marketplaces require similar legal and technical guidance; pooling these resources will be cheaper for everyone. Providing best practices allows marketplaces to focus competition on user experience, community dynamics, and features.
								We are excited to announce the involvement of Dartroom, Algogems, and ZestBloom! These premier marketplaces will work together to create a cooperative network unlike any other crypto community. All other marketplaces are welcome to participate in Kinn DAO.</p>
							<h4>Governance</h4>
							<p>Decentralization is the highest priority, and token holders will be able to vote on all aspects of the project. Kinn DAO aims to achieve decentralization by building robust, open-source, and on-chain resources for Algorandâ€™s NFT community. All holders will be able to vote on feature proposals, tokenomics, and marketplace dynamics. Proposals can be made by top holders and participating marketplaces. Tokens will be released on Tinyman using an issuance schedule to give everyone a fair opportunity.</p>
							<p>Token Allocation and Distribution Schedules Are Coming Soon!</p>
